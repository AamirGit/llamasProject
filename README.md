# llamasProject
Project for open team Chingu cohorts 

The aim of this project is to successfully use git to work on a subversioning platform, and to work collaboratively with other remote web developers/programmers.

The project will attempt to create a page that will house some of the Free Code Camps (henceforth FCC) Intermediate Projects. 

The inital idea for the website is to show the weather at the users current location, link to a wikipedia page telling them some history of the area (maybe have the article come up in the same webpage) then have the images of the area maybe even images pulled from google/flickr/instagram images of the area/location, and then finally some local twitch tv broadcasters in the area
Yeah that sounds good. I'll have a look at the docs for Flickr/Instagram/etc to see if one of them fits what we need.

Some issues that we may face is exoposing api keys, hence looking into how to set up a server that can make the api calls and return the results.
